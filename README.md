README: Simple URL Dispatcher in Python
This code implements a basic URL dispatcher class in Python, mimicking some aspects of a URL configuration system you might find in web frameworks.

Classes:

URLPattern:

Represents a single URL pattern with three attributes:
path: The URL path string (can be extended with regular expressions in the future).
view_func: The Python function to be called when the URL matches.
name (optional): A human-readable name for the pattern (useful for URL reversal, not implemented here).
URLDispatcher:

Manages a collection of URL patterns and handles URL resolution.
__init__: Initializes the dispatcher with an empty list of patterns.
register(path, view_func, name=None): Adds a new URL pattern with the specified path, view function, and optional name.
resolve(path): Iterates through registered patterns and returns the view function's output if a matching path is found. Otherwise, it returns None.
Example Usage:

The provided code demonstrates how to create a URLDispatcher instance, register some URL patterns with corresponding view functions, and then test the resolve method.

Limitations:

This is a simplified version and lacks features like regular expressions for flexible URL matching.
It doesn't handle project-level URL configuration or app inclusion, which are essential for larger applications.
Further Considerations:

For real-world web development, it's highly recommended to use a mature framework like Django that offers a comprehensive and secure solution for URL routing and web request handling.
This code can serve as a learning exercise to understand the basic principles of URL dispatching.
Additional Notes:

Consider including some comments within the code itself to explain the purpose of different parts.
If you plan to extend this code with regular expressions, you'll need to import the re module and use appropriate pattern matching techniques.
